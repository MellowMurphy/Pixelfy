# Pixelfy

Put your *.jpg* or *.png* images into the `inputs\` folder and run `Pixelfy.py`
Multiple different resolution pixelized images will be in their own folders in `outputs\`

***The images are cropped by default by finding the extents of the colored parts of the image using the transparency layer.***
***If your image has no transparency layer, then no background will be removed.*** 

*This is next to be done.*
